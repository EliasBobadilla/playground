# Design a simple yu-gi-oh cardgame for 2 players

## Here are the rules:

- A deck of cards is shuffled and dealt evenly between two players.
- Each round, both players reveal the top card of their deck and compare their life points. The player with the higher life point value wins.
- The winner then takes both of the revealed cards and places them under their deck.
- If there's a tie, each player will place 3 cards into the "victory pile" and then both players reveal the top card of their deck and compare their life point values. The player with the higher life point value takes all the cards from the victory pile plus the two revealed cards. If there's another tie this process repeats.
- The win condition is that there are no cards left in the opponent's deck.
